### Project Description
EchoNotes is a collaborative journal application that allows two users to create, edit, and share daily notes. It provides a clean, intuitive interface where users can log in, record memories, track edits, and navigate through past notes. Think of it as a shared digital scrapbook where users document their thoughts, experiences, and special moments.

### The Problem statement
In today’s fast-paced world, capturing memories, thoughts, and daily moments is often overlooked. EchoNotes addresses the need for a collaborative, easy-to-use digital journal that encourages people to write, reflect, and share their thoughts with someone they care about.

### The Solution
We’ve created a simple yet effective platform where users can log in, add notes, share them with another user, and track edits over time. No more scrambling to find that one journal entry you were looking for—everything is organized and accessible by date. Plus, the collaborative aspect lets you and a friend or partner create shared memories in real-time.
